xpaste - paste text into X windows that don't work with selections
==================================================================

SYNOPSIS
--------

::

    xpaste <<EOF
    This text will be pasted into a window of your choosing.
    EOF


DESCRIPTION
-----------

*Some applications refuse to work with any of the three selection
buffers that X/X11/Xorg has: the* **middle-mouse** *selection,*
**secondary** *selection and the* **CTRL-(SHIFT-)V** *clipboard
selection.*

If you have to insert long or difficult to type text (generated
passwords), not being able to *paste* can be troublesome.

xpaste will read the text to paste from standard input, keep it in
memory and wait for you to press ENTER.  When you do, it pastes the held
text into the newly focused window.

See this *before/after* example where the username is pasted into the
SuperMicro ipmiview Java application that doesn't accept "paste" input
through the middle-mouse or CTRL-V:

.. image:: ./xpaste.png

The pasting of text happens through "faked" keypress events.  And as you
can see from the example, it works.

**NOTE: xpaste now works with Wayland as well: it uses /dev/uinput to
attach a virtual keyboard.**


NOTES
-----

Users on *Wayland* experiencing ``PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission
denied: '/dev/uinput'`` should add a *udev rule* in
``/etc/udev/rules.d/40-uinput.rules``::

    KERNEL=="uinput", SUBSYSTEM=="misc", TAG+="uaccess", OPTIONS+="static_node=uinput"

And run ``udevadm trigger`` once. Afterwards their user should appear in
the ``getfacl /dev/uinput`` output as ``user:someuser:rw-``.
