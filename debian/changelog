    countdown timer so you can focus the right window.

xpaste (1.0~all) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Initial version.
  * Bugs:
    - The control file specifies a dependency on either python or python3
      and either on python-xlib or python3-xlib. But if your python defaults
      to python2, you won't have any use for the dependency on python3-xlib.
